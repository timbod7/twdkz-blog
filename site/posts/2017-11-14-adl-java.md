description: With help, Java can have algebraic data types

At [Helix][hx] we often code backend services in java. I find modern
java _acceptable_ as a language for getting things done. As a long time
haskell developer, however, I find java's facilities for data types
frustrating indeed. These frustrations are twofold. Java lacks support
for algebraic data types ([ADTs][adts]), and requires large amounts of
boilerplate to define even simple types.

When designing systems, I place great value in applying the "make
illegal states unrepresentable" principle[^1]. Using
ADTs to more accurately model data is a excellent step in this
direction. However, it's a burden to do in languages like java that
lack support for [sum types][sumtypes].

Even for regular product types (ie records of fields) java can be
tedious. Defining a record of a few fields should really only take a
corresponding few lines of code. Yet for a useful value type in java
one will generally need to write: constructors, accessors, a
comparison function, a hash implementation, serialisation logic etc.
It's common in the java world to use IDEs to automatically generate
this kind of boilerplate, but subtle bugs can creep in over time as
the once generated code isn't manually updated to reflect subsequent
changes in the data model.

Hence, at Helix we now often use my [ADL language][adl] to define data
types, and generate the corresponding java code from them. As a tiny
example, these adl definitions (see complete file [here][adlexample]):

```
    struct Rectangle
    {
        Double width;
        Double height;
    };

    union Picture
    {
        Circle circle;
        Rectangle rectangle;
        Vector<Picture> composed;
        Translated<Picture> translated;
    };
```

result in the corresponding [Rectangle.java][rectjava] and
[Picture.java][picjava]. These two definitions alone correspond to 280
lines of java code (that you really don't want to write and
maintain). As can be seen in the `Translated<>` type, [parametric
polymorphism][parametricp] is supported.

I find that being able to define data types concisely encourages me to
build more accurate data models, resulting in systems that are more
robust and better reflect the problem domain. And ADL's multi language
support ([java][adljava], [haskell][adlhaskell],
[typescript][adltypescript]) allows us to easily serialize and
transfer the corresponding data values between our java services, and
our typescript web and mobile UIs.
