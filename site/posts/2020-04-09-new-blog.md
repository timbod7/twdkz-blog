I'm planning to write more over the next few months, and want to
move away from the wordpress free tier that has hosted this blog until now.
So, I've migrated all existing content from

[https://twdkz.wordpress.com/][old]

to my new site at

[https://tim.dockerz.net/][new]

This is now hosted at github pages, and uses Chris Penner's [slick website
generator][slick]. slick is a 

> a static site generator written and configured using Haskell... (it) provides
> a small set of tools and combinators for building static websites on top of
> the Shake build system

It's worked out well for me so far.
