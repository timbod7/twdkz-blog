          <p><a href="https://voteflux.org/">voteflux</a> is an interesting new political party, that will field senate candidates at the Australian federal election in July. It's sole policy is to implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegative_democracy">delegative democracy</a>, and to do this within the existing Australian political system. It intends to use blockchain technology to provide cryptographic guarantees to the voting process.</p>
<p>At the time of writing the voteflux software is incomplete, and there is not yet a rigorous specification for how the voting system will work. The voteflux website explains the system at a high level, but leaves questions unanswered. Discussions in the group's slack forums fill in some details, and the parties founders have answered some questions of my own.</p>
<p>In an effort to improve my own understanding of the voteflux ideas, and provide a basis for discussion with others, I've attempted to write an <a href="https://github.com/timbod7/flux-model">executable specification</a> for the system in Haskell. All of the key logic is in <a href="https://github.com/timbod7/flux-model/blob/master/src/Flux.hs">Flux.hs</a>. This was a worthwhile exercise - having to write concrete types and corresponding code made me consider many questions which weren't apparent when thinking less rigourously. Going forward, I intend to build some simulations based upon this code.</p>
<p>Note that this code has no endorsement from the voteflux party - it represents my own efforts to understand the proposed system. But I like their plans, and hope they do well in the election.</p>
